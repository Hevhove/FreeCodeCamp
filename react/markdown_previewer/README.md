## Markdown Previewer
Another project from FCC, building a web app that converts markdown input into formatted markdown. I used the marked package for this one and again built the rest using NextJS Boilerplate, TailwindCSS and NodeJS. I also tried to start using some component libraries so I don't keep reinventing the wheel and have been having some success with TailwindElements. I used their Collapse element in this one. Very neat but how do you adapt the damn thing to start from an open state? If anyone knows, shoot me a DM!
